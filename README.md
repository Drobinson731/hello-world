# hello-world :earth_americas:
Welcome to my first repo :tada:

Im very fortunate to join as a new program manager and learn more about **GitHub** and what it means to be a **Hubber**. 

my name is **Darryl** nicknames include: _drob_, _batman_, or some close friends call me by my middle name _adonis_

Here are some random *fun* facts about me: 

* I love all genres of music
* I have snuck backstage at a **Drake** concert
* I have a modeling contract with :v: agencies & I've appeared on a few reality shows :speak_no_evil: dont tell anyone though, it'll be our secret. 

## before you :runner: -- **I'd like to share some quotes I live by**:


"Do not judge who I am today, for I will not be the same person tomorrow, as I am constantly improving whom I was yesterday"

"Criticism, like rain, should be gentle enough to nourish one's growth without destroying their roots" 

"Team work makes the *Dream* work" 

"The lazy person works the hardest" 

## I hope you make it a great day :wave:
